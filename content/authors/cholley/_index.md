Cameron is a Professor at UNSW Law, a member of the leadership teams of the Connected Waters Initiative Research Centre and the Global Water Institute, UNSW Sydney, as well as the Global Risk Governance Programme, University of Cape Town and The National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training. He was also a member of The Australian Panel of Experts on Environmental Law (APEEL).

Cameron publishes widely in the areas of environmental law, natural resources law, energy law and water law, with a focus on regulation and governance. Within these fields, he has examined issues of compliance and enforcement, environmental security, resilience, planning, accountability, democratic participation, adaptive management and collaborative governance. In addition to his various articles, book chapters, and policy submissions, Cameron's forthcoming book is entitled Intelligent Water Regulation: markets, compliance and technology (Earthscan, 2018). He is the author of The New Environmental Governance (with Neil Gunningham and Clifford Shearing, Routledge, 2012) and co-editor of Reforming Water Law and Governance (Springer, 2018), Criminology and the Anthropocene (Routledge, 2017) and Trans-jurisdictional Water Law and Governance (Earthscan, 2016).

An empirical researcher, Cameron has worked closely with Australian and international government and non-government organisations on a range of environmental and natural resource management research projects. His current research agenda is centred on water law and energy governance, including unconventional gas, renewable energy, water planning, conventional regulation and monitoring of groundwater use.

In 2014, Cameron was awarded the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Academy of Environmental Law Junior Scholarship Award for his contribution to environmental law scholarship.

He is an Editorial Board member on the Environmental and Planning Law Journal, and in 2016 was the guest editor of a Special Issue of the Environmental and Planning Law Journal (EPLJ Vol 33 Part 4), entitled Rethinking Water Law and Governance. He is a PLuS Alliance Fellow and was previously the Co-Director of Postgraduate Studies at UNSW Law and Deputy Convenor of the Human Research Ethics Advisory Panel B: Arts, Humanities and Law.
