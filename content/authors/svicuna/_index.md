His areas of research as a water resources engineer are focused on integrated water resources management at the basin level.

In recent years Sebastian has studied the effects of climate change on water resources in California and other regional settings in Central and South America. The emphasis of his recent work has been the exploration of adaptation strategies to these impacts.

Sebastian received in 2004 a Master in Public Policy and a Master in Science in Civil & Environmental Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley.

In 2007 he received a PhD in Civil & Environmental Engineering from the same university. Prior to his studies in United States, he worked on a wide range of environment-related projects in Chile.
