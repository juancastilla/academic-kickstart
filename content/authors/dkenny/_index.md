After graduating, he worked in the Governor of Illinois’ Office of Legislative Affairs, before moving to Australia to complete his Master’s of Environmental Management and Development at the Australian National University. He is now a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney, focusing on how behavioural science and simulation modelling can    be used to drive long-term sustainable behaviours with farming stakeholders in socio-environmental systems.
